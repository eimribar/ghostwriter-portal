# Fix for Content Ideas Not Loading

## Problem
Content ideas from GPT-5 web search are not being saved to the database due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies blocking inserts. This prevents ideas from appearing after page refresh.

## Solution

### Option 1: Disable RLS (Quick Fix for Development)

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ifwscuvbtdokljwwbvex/sql/new
2. Run this SQL command:
```sql
ALTER TABLE content_ideas DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
3. Click "Run"
4. Refresh your app and try searching again

### Option 2: Fix RLS Policies (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ifwscuvbtdokljwwbvex/sql/new
2. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_content_ideas_rls.sql` file
3. Click "Run"
4. Refresh your app and try searching again

## What Was Fixed in the Code

1. **Added detailed logging** to track save operations
2. **Added error handling** to show when saves fail
3. **Fixed TypeScript types** for proper status values
4. **Created SQL files** to fix database permissions

## Testing After Fix

1. Go to the Ideation page
2. Search for "find me the top 10 trending topics (news) with context related to b2b saas, ai and marketing. actual news from the past week"
3. Wait for results (2-5 minutes)
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Refresh the page - ideas should now persist
