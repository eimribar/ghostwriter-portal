# CRITICAL: GPT-5 MODEL INFORMATION

## GPT-5 EXISTS AND IS FULLY DOCUMENTED

### DO NOT CHANGE THE MODEL NAME
- The model name is: `gpt-5`
- This is CORRECT and WORKING
- GPT-5 is a real, existing model from OpenAI
- Full documentation is in GPT5_README.md

### THE MODEL IS NOT THE PROBLEM
- If API calls fail, it's NOT because of the model name
- Check the API key configuration instead
- Check network/authentication issues
- But NEVER change from gpt-5

### Model Variants Available:
- `gpt-5` - Main model
- `gpt-5-mini` - Smaller, faster variant
- `gpt-5-nano` - Smallest variant

## Current Configuration
```javascript
model: 'gpt-5' // THIS IS CORRECT - DO NOT CHANGE
```

## If You See Errors:
1. Check if API key is loaded (console: API Key exists: true/false)
2. Check Vercel environment variables
3. Check network connectivity
4. But NEVER assume gpt-5 doesn't exist - IT DOES!
