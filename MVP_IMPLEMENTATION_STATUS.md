## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### Current System Flow
```
Admin Portal (React)
├── ClientSwitchContext (manages active client)
├── Navigation (shows client switcher)
├── ClientSwitcher (dropdown UI)
├── Multi-user Services (API layer)
└── Enhanced Database Schema

User Portal (React) 
├── Existing approval interface
└── Shared Supabase database

Mobile PWA (Future)
├── PIN/biometric auth
├── Swipe approval interface
└── Offline sync capability
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Admin selects client → Updates session
2. Session persists → Database + localStorage  
3. Content generation → Uses client's personalized prompts
4. Generated content → Tagged with client_id
5. User portal → Shows only their content
6. Mobile app → Receives push notifications
7. Approvals sync → Back to admin portal
```
