# SSO Email - Final Fix Summary

## üö® Critical Issue Found & Fixed

### The Root Cause
The `vercel.json` configuration was rewriting **ALL** routes to `/index.html`, including API routes. This prevented the `/api/send-invitation` endpoint from ever being reached.

```json
// OLD (BROKEN):
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*)",        // Catches EVERYTHING including /api/*
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]

// NEW (FIXED):
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/((?!api/).*)", // Excludes /api/* routes
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

## All Issues Fixed (in order):

1. **Domain not verified** ‚Üí Changed to `onboarding@resend.dev` ‚úÖ
2. **Environment detection** ‚Üí Fixed `import.meta.env.PROD` ‚úÖ
3. **Missing API key fallback** ‚Üí Added fallback pattern ‚úÖ
4. **API routes blocked** ‚Üí Fixed Vercel rewrites ‚úÖ

## Testing After Deployment

### 1. Check Browser Console
When you send an invitation, you should now see:
```
üìß Attempting to send email via: /api/send-invitation
Environment: PRODUCTION
Full URL would be: https://ghostwriter-portal-qxibjego6-yessai.vercel.app/api/send-invitation
Response status: 200
Response ok: true
‚úÖ Email API response: {success: true, messageId: "..."}
```

### 2. If Still Not Working
Check for these specific errors in console:
- `Response status: 404` = API route still not found (rewrite issue)
- `Response status: 500` = API key missing in Vercel
- `Response status: 403` = Resend domain issue

### 3. Verify in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to Functions tab
2. Look for `/api/send-invitation`
3. Check the logs for any errors

## Environment Variables Required in Vercel

Make sure BOTH are set:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_Vawe4nHB_BiRgoqiZmw1cWXjTyHZFBzS1
VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_Vawe4nHB_BiRgoqiZmw1cWXjTyHZFBzS1
```

## Why This Should Work Now

- **Slack emails work** = Backend to backend (cron job) ‚úÖ
- **SSO emails didn't work** = Frontend couldn't reach API (blocked by rewrite) ‚ùå
- **Now fixed** = API routes excluded from rewrite ‚úÖ

## Deployment Status

- **Pushed to GitHub**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Vercel Auto-Deploy**: Should be building now
- **ETA**: 2-3 minutes for deployment

Once deployed, the emails should finally work properly!
