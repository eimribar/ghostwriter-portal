post 1:

""Our RevOps AI is the least glamorous agent we're building. It might also be the one with the biggest impact on revenue.

It doesn't write copy. It doesn't design ads. It doesn't chat with prospects.

It just does the insanely valuable, tedious work that no one really wants to do:

- Connects our CRM, billing, and product usage data
- Flags accounts with low engagement 90 days before renewal
- Cleans and enriches lead data before it hits sales
- Automates our pipeline forecasting
- Finds upsell opportunities based on product usage patterns

The creative AIs get all the attention.

But the agent that just quietly makes the data trustworthy… that's the one that makes everything else possible."
"

POST 2:

"Why this is the GREATEST time to be building a software startup

1. Millions of people actually want to try new AI products 
2. Building software is way easier now
3. Anyone can go viral overnight (it's possible)
4. APIs turned everything into Lego blocks, you can build on top of Stripe, OpenAI, Twilio without rebuilding infrastructure 
5. Remote work makes it easier to find people to build with you
6. Agents/automation are making business making more efficient than ever
7. You don't need VC to get going 
8. The playing field has never been this leveled 

"BuT iT'S mOrE CoMpEtiTive ThAn EveR"

Yeah, more people are building. But most of it is pretty mid. It doesn't really address the pain point or it does it in a way that doesn't really speak to them. 

Competition has always existed. The difference is now you have the same tools as billion-dollar companies. Low barriers to entry cut both ways - yes more competitors can enter, but so can you.

"YoU mAkE it SoUnD So EaSY"

Building is easier. Building the RIGHT thing is still hard as heck.

Most people give up after month one when they realize coding was the easy part. Distribution, retention, finding product-market fit - that's where 99% fail.

The tools got better. The game didn't get easier.

But if you can push through the hard parts that eliminate most people...

You're competing in a market with infinite demand and the best building tools in history."

post 3: 

""Top reps can sell anything to anyone."

That's the biggest myth in sales.

The reality?

- Top performers disqualify faster than they qualify.
- They don't waste time on leads that don't fit their ICP
- They're maniacal about protecting their time
- They look for pain and dig deep to understand it
- If the buyer isn't a fit, they walk away—quickly
- They're obsessed with finding real problems to solve

The truth is, top reps aren't magic sellers.

They're just incredibly focused on who they spend their time with.

They don't waste energy chasing people who will never buy.

They look for strong signals and cut the rest.

If you're still trying to sell to everyone, 

you're selling to no one."

post examples:

post 1:

"By the end of the year we should have 10 AIs/agents in production at SaaStr. It's really a >lot< of work to manage them:

- 3 AI SDRs (tickets, sponsors, sales support)
- 2 AI BDRs (qualify leads, help leads)
- 1 AI Support (help on any events issues)
- 1 AI Mentor (SaaStr.ai) 
- 1 AI Content Review (speakers, sessions)
- 1 AI RevOps (track & manage sponsors, enable sales)
- 1 AI Matchmaking (CEOs + execs)

Possibly more. Each requires >daily< management and review.

However … the AIs never quit. They work weekends. They don't complain. They aren't more focused on their courses or side-hustles. They can scale up or down as needed.

And they know the products cold. Cold."

POST 2:

"I love the CEOs I've invested in, but oftentimes, I sort of prefer to hang out with … the CTOs.

It's not because I'm technical. I'm not.

It's because I've lived the pain of building a software company from $0 to $200m+ ARR so I know:

- an S-tier CTO that truly wants it … is close to all that matters
- a CTO that is truly better than the competition, almost always wins
- the best CTOs are super honest and don't paper over issues
- the CEO gets all the attention
- most VCs who weren't founders don't really know what a great CTO is or why they matter

So I do love the CEOs I've invested in …

I'd just sort of, kind of, rather quietly hang out with the S-tiers CTOs."

post 3: 

"Founders never get "too senior" to do the actual work

They'll always do it, Day 1 or Day 1000

This is often why we struggle with VPs that won't. And make mishires here.

We just assume they will."

post examples:

post 1:

"I've signed off on a few $600k+ annual earnings for tech AEs. I haven't seen many perform at that level. But the ones who did, did it the 'hard' way—and it's not what you think... Here's what choosing the 'easy' vs 'hard' way looks like in sales:

- Talk vs Listen
- Sell to vs Sell with
- Telling vs Showing
- Push vs Get pulled
- Pressure vs Patience
- Pitch vs Conversation
- Convince vs Empower
- Features vs Outcomes
- Script vs Being present
- Our quota vs Their goals
- Our product vs Their problem
- Transaction vs Transformation
- Our process vs Supporting theirs
- More activities vs Better activities
- Short-term vs Lifetime relationship
- Giving a demo vs Validating pain-solvers
- How we want to sell vs How they want to buy
- What we want to sell vs What they want to buy

It's far easier (and lazier) to focus on 'us'.

Focusing on our buyers is hard work.

Empathizing, putting thought into actions, and effort into a real conversation.

But as easy as it feels to send another "just checking in" email.

It is the hardest way for you to reach that quota.

The truth is:

You can't actually 'sell' anyone…

You can only create the conditions for them to buy.

And if you work hard at doing that.

They eventually will.

Ditch the easy way.

Put in the work.

POST 2:

"An EVP buyer at a $10B firm won't watch your demo. They won't read your 25-slide deck. And they won't be your champion. You can't treat them as any other buyer. Here are 5 ways most AEs get Exec Selling wrong (and the fix):


1. Trying To Make Them Champions

Execs shouldn't be champions. They suck at it. They're way too busy for your follow-ups. They're too high-level to be running an evaluation. They rarely even understand the day-to-day; that's why they have middle management.

FIX: Get your execs to build relationships with them early on. Keep them informed, educated about the problem, but find real champions to sell with you.


2. Giving Them a 'Standard Demo'

Execs care about outcomes - revenue growth, cost savings, reduced risk. They delegate the "how it works" to their teams. Spending 30min walking through features, believing they will care, is a sure failure.

FIX: Lead with their problem and get them to share their perspective. Move to teaching them something new about their problem, to sharing customer stories, and the high-level solution - that's enough (just be ready to demo if asked).


3. Thinking They'll Read Your 25-Slide Deck

Execs will either skim or fully ignore big slide decks. Usually ignore. They want punchy insights in a 5-10 minute read. A polished, lengthy deck will NOT impress anyone. Quite the opposite, they'll feel they don't get it and that the project is too complex.

FIX: Build a 1-2 page business case. Focus on the problem, the impact, and the ask. Short. Punchy. Unignorable. If you must send slides, trim the fluff, apply the same principles, and save the details for the project team.


4. Selling 'Product-Level' Problems

Execs don't care about (or understand) granular problems (e.g. cutting X manual steps). Your champion gets excited since they feel the day-to-day pain, and it validates that your product will work. But execs need a bigger why.

FIX: Sell a business transformation - position your solution as a catalyst for top-line impact. E.g. Board-level OKRs, strategic changes like shifting upmarket, or a big cost-saving focus ahead of IPO.

——

Execs won't drive.

They steer from the top.

So leave the details to real champions.

Don't demo, send big decks, or sell small problems.

Be strategic, brief, and to the point.

And make sure to think like them: THINK BIG."

"OpenAI vs Anthropic Revenue Race … today:

• OpenAI: $12B ARR
• Anthropic: $4B ARR
• Gap: 3x (down from 20x in 2022)

Year-End 2025 Projections:

• OpenAI: $18B 
• Anthropic: $9B
• Gap: 2x (continued rapid convergence)

Growth Velocity (2025 YTD):

• OpenAI: 2x growth in 7 months ($6B → $12B)
• Anthropic: 4x growth in 7 months ($1B → $4B)

3-Year Revenue Multipliers (2022-2025E):

• OpenAI: 90x growth ($200M → $18B)
• Anthropic: 900x growth ($10M → $9B)

Strategic Positioning

OpenAI:

• Consumer dominance (500M weekly users)
• 70% revenue from ChatGPT subscriptions
• $300B+ valuation, clear market leader

Anthropic:

• Enterprise focus (80% B2B revenue)
• Code generation leadership
• $170B valuation, fastest growth challenger

Bottom Line

This is one of the most dramatic catch-up stories in enterprise software history. Anthropic has closed a 20x revenue gap to 2x in just 3 years, growing 10x faster than OpenAI. 

While OpenAI maintains leadership through consumer scale, Anthropic's enterprise-first strategy and superior growth velocity suggest the revenue race will be incredibly tight by 2026-2027.

The market is clearly big enough for multiple $10B+ AI revenue players."
