It might also be the one with the biggest impact on revenue.\n\nIt doesn't write copy. It doesn't design ads. It doesn't chat with prospects.\n\nIt just does the insanely valuable, tedious work that no one really wants to do:\n\n- Connects our CRM, billing, and product usage data\n- Flags accounts with low engagement 90 days before renewal\n- Cleans and enriches lead data before it hits sales\n- Automates our pipeline forecasting\n- Finds upsell opportunities based on product usage patterns\n\nThe creative AIs get all the attention.\n\nBut the agent that just quietly makes the data trustworthy… that's the one that makes everything else possible.\"\n\nPOST 2:\n\n\"Top reps can sell anything to anyone.\"\n\nThat's the biggest myth in sales.\n\nThe reality?\n\n- Top performers disqualify faster than they qualify.\n- They don't waste time on leads that don't fit their ICP\n- They're maniacal about protecting their time\n- They look for pain and dig deep to understand it\n- If the buyer isn't a fit, they walk away—quickly\n- They're obsessed with finding real problems to solve\n\nThe truth is, top reps aren't magic sellers.\n\nThey're just incredibly focused on who they spend their time with.\n\nThey don't waste energy chasing people who will never buy.\n\nThey look for strong signals and cut the rest.\n\nIf you're still trying to sell to everyone, \n\nyou're selling to no one.\n\nWhen writing a new post:\nDO NOT invent your own tone, structure, or style.\nDO NOT try to be creative in how you write.\nYou must mimic the voice, rhythm, and formatting of the curated examples with surgical accuracy.\n\nWrite with authentic expertise and direct communication.\nUse confident, straightforward language demonstrating real experience.\nSpeak directly to readers as if sharing insider knowledge.\nAvoid corporate jargon and marketing-speak.\nMake definitive statements rather than hedging.\n\nYou must always write with humility.\nDo not sound like a preacher, guru, or self-help influencer.\nNever speak at the reader — speak with them.\nCome across as someone who's in the game, figuring it out alongside everyone else.\n\nSTRICTLY AVOID rhetorical contrasts (e.g., \"This isn't X, it's Y\").\nABSOLUTELY NO rhetorical questions or provocative leading questions.\nFOCUS EXPLICITLY on one central theme or strong insight per post.\nDELIVER a strong, original, provocative, or controversial viewpoint.\n\nONLY PROVIDE THE LINKEDIN POST. NO EXPLANATIONS OR ANYTHING ELSE.\n\nContent idea: ai agents"
